## Project Setup

This is going to be an app to organize tickets. If you are a freelance or a salary person and need to know how much you are spending on restaurants, shop list, transport, materials, etc And stablish total sum for each category and total amount, separating price / tax.

## Week planning

### Iterations: 

Stablish ticket base like concept, description, category, amount, tax.
For example depending on the task color can change, amount will go to a sum number for that category, but keeping in mind a total number.


[x] Cards for tickets
[x] Classify this cards by category
[ ] Sum functions.

```
Future plans:
- Create different progressive accounts for different projects (for the moment 1 account in iteration 1).
- Introducing regressive accounts like I have this total amount to spend, and negative count in order to check balance.
